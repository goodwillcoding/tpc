            in the Python language, such as function decorators, are available
            to Pyramid developers. Here we show the function named "home" has a
            decorator "@view_config" which assigns a route to it.</p>

          <p><strong>Megaframeworks</strong> make decisions for you. But if you don't fit their viewpoint, you end up fighting their decisions. <strong>Microframeworks</strong> force no decisions, making it easy to start. But as your application grows, you're on your own.</p>
          <p>In both cases, the focus is on the <strong>start</strong>: either too much or too little. Either way, finishing and staying finished is hard. You need a <strong>finishing-focused</strong> framework with an architectural design that scales down to getting started, then up as your application grows.</p>

          <p>Getting started quickly and simply is a key attraction of lightweight frameworks. Equally, you get to choose what approaches to use for templating, database, security, and more, or use a convenient starting point with a scaffold. Pyramid excels at scaling down to the first hour of learning, while avoiding the pitfalls of framework magic.</p>
          <ul class="features">
            <li>Start as a <strong>single-file module</strong> with little first-hour complexity</li>
